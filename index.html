        <h1>Capability Statement</h1>
        <p>My name is Sakiru Ayanyemi Ganiyu, I am a trained dental surgeon from the College of Medicine University of Lagos and a Master of Public Health graduate from Western Sydney University. I am seeking employment as a public health professional with the New South Wales (NSW) Health.  I have been in the business of health care for more than two decades. I have pioneered four viable practices in the commercial capital of Nigeria-Lagos. I came into Australia to improve my skills in public health in Western Sydney University. This has enabled me to gain the needed “doxa” in the field of public health, a skill Grenfell and Wacquant showed to be transferable in their studies (Grenfell, 2009; Wacquant, 1998). Western Sydney University has greatly increased my capitals, the knowledge I gained has helped me to become a better public health administrator, I have increased my social capital with interactions with my lecturers and my colleagues who are also from diverse backgrounds (Wacquant, 1998). Thus, contributing to my social capitals (Wacquant, 1998) and has greatly improves my skills in the space of public health. Western Sydney University has also helped me to meet industry heavy weights some even taught us as guest lecturer, one of such rear privilege was Professor Foley who taught us health care financing. This exposure has enlightened me more about health economics as the bedrock for any functional health system (Green, 2007). This has helped me to understand how a functional health system works.

            As a public health professional, I am committed to equity and social justice, promoting health equity and addressing health disparities, particularly among marginalized and vulnerable populations, This was exemplified by Peter et al and Stivers et al  (Peter, 2001; Stivers et al., 2023). Using the best available evidence to inform my work and ensure that interventions are effective and efficient. Moreso, working collaboratively with community partners, healthcare providers, and policymakers to achieve shared goals, a role Babor et al and Rychetnik showed in their works (Babor et al., 2023; Rychetnik et al., 2002). I demonstrated this while setting up my clinics in Lagos. Adhering to ethical principles in all aspects of my work, including informed consent, privacy protection, and respect for human dignity as shown in the study conducted by Arellano (Arellano et al., 2023). Continuously developing my knowledge and skills to stay up to date with the latest evidence and best practices in public health ecosystem. Recognizing and respecting the cultural diversity of the communities I serve and tailoring interventions to meet their specific needs, Okolo et al revealed this in the study (Okolo et al., 2024). Promoting sustainable health practices and systems that can be maintained over the long term .
            I believe that public health is a noble profession that has the potential to make a significant difference in the lives of individuals and communities (Laverack, 2006). Therefore, I am dedicated to using my skills and knowledge to improve health outcomes and promote a healthier and more equitable society. My background in the private sector has also helped me to form my habitus in health care delivery (Wacquant, 1998). This gained skill will help me to be a better health administrator in the New South Wales Health.
            Some of the areas I have been exposed to while training in western Sydney University include health promotion and disease prevention: I have a strong foundation in health promotion and disease prevention strategies, with a focus on chronic diseases and health disparities, a needed skill exemplified by Snelling in her study in 2023 (Snelling, 2023). I have experience in developing and implementing evidence-based interventions to address these issues. For example, I led a successful community-based program to promote physical activity and healthy eating among low-income families, resulting in significant improvements in health outcomes in Katoomba health district, Abraham et al in 2023 shows it in their study  (Abrahams et al., 2023). I am skilled in building partnerships with community organizations, healthcare providers, and government agencies to address public health challenges. I have experience in conducting community needs assessments, developing culturally appropriate interventions, and mobilizing community support, an example is in the work of Bryant et al (Bryant et al., 2024). For instance, I worked with a local Aboriginal community to develop a smoking cessation program that was tailored to their cultural beliefs and practices, this was after the example set by Bryant in 2024 (Bryant et al., 2024). Furthermore, I have expertise in developing and delivering effective health education materials and programs. I have experience in creating culturally appropriate educational resources and conducting workshops on various health topics, Michealsen revealed this in the study  (Michaelsen et al., 2023). For example, I developed a series of health education videos on nutrition and physical activity that were distributed to schools and community centers in Blue Mountain, rural area. Not only that, but I am also proficient in using data analysis techniques to identify trends, disparities, and areas for improvement. I have experience in analysing health data from various sources, including surveys, administrative databases, and electronic health records. This “doxa’’ was gained from a course taken by Associate professor Kingsley-data for decision making and was also demonstrated in the work of Mashoufi  (Mashoufi et al., 2023).  In short, I conducted a study to examine the relationship between socioeconomic status and health outcomes in a specific population.
            Moreso, I have a strong foundation in clinical dentistry, including preventive, restorative, and cosmetic treatments. I have experience in providing high-quality dental care to patients of all ages and backgrounds. Furthermore, I am skilled in managing dental practice, including financial management, staff management, and patient relations. I have experience in developing business plans, marketing strategies, and quality improvement initiatives. I am passionate about oral health promotion and have experience in developing and implementing community outreach programs. I have worked with schools, community organizations, and healthcare providers to promote oral health education and access to dental care. I have experience in developing new business opportunities and building partnerships with other healthcare providers. I have successfully negotiated contracts, expanded my practice, and developed new services. These areas of expertise, combined with my strong work ethic and commitment to public health, make me an asset to any organization. I am confident in my ability to contribute to the success of your team and achieve our shared goals of the New South Wales health.
            
            My strength includes strong foundation in public health this has helped me to have a solid understanding of public health principles and a commitment to improving health outcomes. The World Health Organisation depicts this in the report of 2024 (Organization, 2024). I have experience working with diverse populations and can adapt my approach to meet their specific needs and cultural preferences. I can communicate effectively with a wide range of stakeholders, including community members, healthcare providers, and policymakers. I have a strong foundation in data analysis and can use data to inform decision-making and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, Adenyi et al shows this (Adenyi et al., 2024). This capital is a product of data for decision making. I can identify and address challenges effectively, and I am always looking for innovative solutions to public health problems. I was able to solve the problem of accessibility to oral care need by partnering with the local government in my country to establish dental clinics within the local council on a public-private-partnership basis (PPP), an approach Madu and Osborne demonstrated it effect in their study (Madu & Osborne, 2023).  In short, this was a new approach to solving health care problem in Nigeria.
            
            However, my weaknesses include time management; I can sometimes struggle to manage my time effectively and prioritize tasks. I may be hesitant to delegate tasks to others, which can limit my productivity and efficiency.  While I am comfortable speaking in public, I could improve my skills in delivering presentations and engaging with audiences.
            In view of the above, and to overcome these weaknesses and continue to improve my practice, I will focus on the following areas: time management; I will implement time management strategies, such as setting clear goals, prioritizing tasks, and avoiding procrastination, Bracken shows it effectiveness in the study in conducted (Bracken et al., 2023). I will learn to delegate tasks effectively to team members and empower them to take on responsibility. Moreover, I will seek opportunities to practice public speaking and seek feedback from others. I will also consider taking a public speaking course. I will continue to seek out opportunities for professional development and stay up to date with the latest trends and best practices in public health. By addressing these areas of weakness, I can become a more effective and efficient public health professional. I am committed to lifelong learning and continuous improvement, and I will strive to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the health and well-being of individuals and communities.

            Reflective Practice and Ethical Considerations:
            I am committed to reflective practice as a means of improving my professional development and ethical decision-making. Reflective practice involves regularly reflecting on my experiences, identifying areas for improvement, and learning from my mistakes, a method that Tovey and Archibald demonstrated its effectiveness (Tovey & Archibald, 2023). I also adhere to a strong ethical framework in my work. I believe in the importance of informed consent, privacy protection, and respect for human dignity. I am committed to ensuring that my actions are always guided by ethical principles and that I am accountable for my decisions.
