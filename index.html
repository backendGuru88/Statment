        <h1>Capability Statement.</h1>
        <p> 
          My name is Sakiru Ayanyemi Ganiyu. I am a trained dental surgeon from the College of Medicine University of Lagos and a Master of Public Health graduate from Western Sydney University.<br>
          I am seeking employment as a public health professional with New South Wales (NSW) Health. I have been in the healthcare field for more than two decades and have pioneered four viable practices in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital.<br> 
          I came to Australia to improve my skills in public health at Western Sydney University. This has enabled me to gain essential knowledge in the field, or “doxa,” as described by Grenfell and Wacquant (Grenfell, 2009; Wacquant, 1998).<br>
          Western Sydney University has greatly increased my capital, equipping me to be a better public health administrator. My social capital has grown through my interactions with professors and colleagues from diverse backgrounds, enriching my perspective and skills in public health.<br>
          At Western Sydney University, I had the opportunity to learn from industry experts, including Professor Foley, who taught healthcare financing. This exposure has deepened my understanding of health economics as a foundation for a functional health system (Green, 2007).<br>

          As a public health professional, I am committed to equity and social justice, promoting health equity and addressing health disparities, particularly among marginalized populations (Peter, 2001; Stivers et al., 2023).<br>
          I prioritize using the best evidence to guide my work, ensuring interventions are effective and efficient.<br> 
          I am experienced in collaborating with community partners, healthcare providers, and policymakers to achieve shared goals, as emphasized in the works of Babor et al. and Rychetnik et al. (Babor et al., 2023; Rychetnik et al., 2002).<br>
          For example, I successfully collaborated with tribal leaders while establishing clinics in Lagos to address community-specific health needs.<br>
          I adhere to ethical principles, including informed consent, privacy protection, and respect for human dignity, as outlined in Arellano's study (Arellano et al., 2023).<br>
          Additionally, I am committed to continuously updating my skills, respecting cultural diversity, and tailoring interventions to meet specific needs, as noted by Okolo et al. (Okolo et al., 2024).<br>

          I believe public health is a noble profession capable of making a significant difference in individual and community lives (Laverack, 2006).<br>
          My background in private healthcare has shaped my "habitus" in health service delivery (Wacquant, 1998). This skill will support my work as a health administrator with NSW Health.<br>

          While at Western Sydney University, I have gained expertise in health promotion and disease prevention, focusing on chronic diseases and health disparities, as exemplified by Snelling (Snelling, 2023).<br>
          I have developed and implemented community-based interventions, such as a program to encourage physical activity and healthy eating among low-income families, leading to improved health outcomes in the Katoomba health district.<br>
          I have experience in assessing community needs, building partnerships with community organizations, and tailoring interventions culturally, as shown in the work of Bryant et al. (Bryant et al., 2024).<br>
          For instance, I collaborated with an Aboriginal community to create a culturally sensitive smoking cessation program, informed by Bryant's 2024 study.<br>
          My skills include developing health education materials and conducting workshops, as demonstrated in Michealsen's work (Michaelsen et al., 2023).<br>
          I also use data analysis techniques to identify trends and evaluate intervention effectiveness, a skill acquired from a course taught by Associate Professor Kingsley and supported by Mashoufi's work (Mashoufi et al., 2023).<br>

          I am proficient in clinical dentistry, providing preventive, restorative, and cosmetic treatments.<br>
          Additionally, I have managed a dental practice, including finances, staffing, and patient relations, and developed new services through effective business strategies.<br>
          My experience makes me an asset to any organization. I am confident in my ability to contribute to NSW Health’s success and shared goals.<br>

          My strengths include a strong public health foundation, effective communication, adaptability to diverse populations, and data analysis skills (Organization, 2024).<br>
          However, I aim to improve time management and public speaking.<br>
          To overcome these weaknesses, I am implementing time management strategies and seeking public speaking opportunities, as demonstrated by Bracken (Bracken et al., 2023).<br>
          I am dedicated to lifelong learning and continuous improvement, using my skills to positively impact public health.<br>

          Reflective Practice and Ethical Considerations:
          I am committed to reflective practice as a means of improving my professional development and ethical decision-making. Reflective practice involves regularly reflecting on my experiences, identifying areas for improvement, and learning from my mistakes, a method that Tovey and Archibald demonstrated its effectiveness (Tovey & Archibald, 2023). I also adhere to a strong ethical framework in my work. I believe in the importance of informed consent, privacy protection, and respect for human dignity.
