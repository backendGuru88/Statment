        <h1>Capability Statement.</h1>
        <p>My name is Sakiru Ayanyemi Ganiyu, a dedicated dental surgeon and Master of Public Health graduate, seeking an impactful role with NSW Health. My professional journey spans over 20 years of healthcare experience, including the founding of four successful practices in Lagos, Nigeria. My transition to public health was driven by a desire to expand my expertise, culminating in an MPH from Western Sydney University. Here, I honed essential skills in public health, health economics, and social justice, focusing on addressing the unique health challenges of diverse populations.</p>

        <p><strong>Core Public Health Expertise</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Health Promotion and Disease Prevention:</strong> My foundation in health promotion and disease prevention emphasizes chronic disease management and addressing health disparities. I have implemented evidence-based community interventions, such as a successful program in Katoomba, which significantly improved health outcomes by promoting physical activity and healthy eating among low-income families.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Collaborative Community Engagement:</strong> Through my training at Western Sydney University, I gained experience in building partnerships with community organizations, healthcare providers, and government bodies. This work includes culturally tailored interventions, such as a smoking cessation program with an Aboriginal community, demonstrating my ability to mobilize support and engage diverse groups effectively.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Data-Driven Public Health Practice:</strong> My training includes data analysis for decision-making, which I applied in a study examining socioeconomic status and health outcomes. This experience enables me to identify trends, disparities, and areas for improvement, ensuring that my interventions are evidence-based, relevant, and efficient.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Clinical Dental Experience</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Quality Dental Care:</strong> With a Bachelor of Dental Surgery from the University of Lagos, I bring a robust foundation in preventive, restorative, and cosmetic dental treatments. I have led multiple dental practices, emphasizing quality care, financial management, and staff development. My approach includes developing culturally appropriate educational materials and outreach programs, such as oral health education initiatives in schools and community centers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Innovation in Healthcare Access:</strong> In Lagos, I implemented public-private partnerships with local governments to establish accessible dental clinics in underserved areas. This pioneering approach improved oral health access, reflecting my commitment to sustainable health solutions for marginalized communities.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Strengths and Areas for Development</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Public Health Knowledge:</strong> Solid understanding of public health principles, with a strong focus on improving health outcomes through effective interventions and collaborative partnerships.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Analysis Skills:</strong> Proficient in leveraging data to guide decisions and evaluate health initiatives, with a goal to use insights for impactful public health improvements.</p>
        <p><strong>Adaptability and Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> Experienced in working with diverse populations, with a flexible approach tailored to meet specific community needs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Areas for Growth:</strong> While skilled in various public health and clinical practices, I am continuously working on time management and delegation to enhance productivity. Public speaking is another area where I seek improvement; I plan to refine these skills through targeted courses and practice.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Commitment to Ethical Standards and Reflective Practice:</strong> Reflective practice is central to my professional development, encouraging continuous improvement and accountability. My approach to ethical decision-making aligns with principles of informed consent, privacy protection, and respect for human dignity, ensuring that I consistently uphold the highest standards in all aspects of my work.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Education, Affiliations, and Continuous Learning</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Education:</strong> BDS from the University of Lagos, Graduate Certificate in Public Health from the University of Wollongong, and MPH from Western Sydney University.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional Development:</strong> I remain committed to lifelong learning to stay current with advancements in the public health sector, ensuring my approach remains innovative and effective.</p>
