        <h1>Capability Statement.</h1>
        <p>My name is Sakiru Ayanyemi Ganiyu, a dedicated dental surgeon and Master of Public Health graduate, seeking an impactful role with NSW Health. My professional journey spans over 20 years of healthcare experience and includes pioneering four successful practices in Lagos, Nigeria. My transition to public health was driven by a desire to expand my expertise, culminating in my MPH at Western Sydney University, where I honed essential skills in public health, health economics, and social justice to address the unique health challenges of diverse populations.

            <strong>Core Public Health Expertise</strong> 
            Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
            My foundation in health promotion and disease prevention strategies emphasizes chronic disease management and addressing health disparities. I have implemented evidence-based community interventions, such as a successful program in Katoomba, which significantly improved health outcomes by promoting physical activity and healthy eating among low-income families.
            
            <strong>Collaborative Community Engagement</strong>
            Through Western Sydney University, I gained experience in building partnerships with community organizations, healthcare providers, and government bodies. My work includes culturally tailored interventions, such as developing a smoking cessation program with an Aboriginal community, which reflects my ability to mobilize support and engage diverse groups effectively.
            
            <strong>Data-Driven Public Health Practice</strong>
            My training includes data analysis for decision-making, which I applied in a study examining socioeconomic status and health outcomes. This experience enables me to identify trends, disparities, and areas for improvement, ensuring that my interventions are evidence-based, relevant, and efficient.
            
           <strong> Clinical Dental Experience</strong>
            Quality Dental Care
            With a Bachelor of Dental Surgery from the University of Lagos, I bring a robust foundation in preventive, restorative, and cosmetic dental treatments. I have led multiple dental practices, emphasizing quality care, financial management, and staff development. My approach includes developing culturally appropriate educational materials and outreach programs, such as oral health education initiatives in schools and community centers.
            
            <strong>Innovation in Healthcare Access</strong>
            In Lagos, I implemented public-private partnerships with local governments to establish accessible dental clinics in underserved areas. This pioneering approach improved oral health access, reflecting my commitment to sustainable health solutions for marginalized communities.
